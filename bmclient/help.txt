Usage:
    bmclient -h|-v|-m<mode> <mode specific options>

Dump all data using '-md' or '-m dump':
    bmclient -m dump [-u <units>] [-f <format>]

    Values allowed for 'units' are:
        b - all values displayed in bytes (default)
        a - values displayed with abbreviated units
        f - values displayed with full units

Display a database summary using '-ms' or '-m summary':
    bmclient -m summary

Monitor current usage using '-mm' or '-m monitor':
    bmclient -m monitor

Query the database using '-mq' or '-m query':
    bmclient -m query -r <range> [-g <grouping>] [-u <units>]

    The 'range' argument specifies the date/time range for which you want to see information. The range can consist of either 1 or 2 date components, if 2 date components are present then they must be separated by a hyphen. Each date component can be in 1 of 4 different formats, shown below:
        yyyy        - a 4 digit year
        yyyymm      - a year followed by a 2 digit month
        yyyymmdd    - a year and month followed by a 2 digit day
        yyyymmddhh  - a year, month and day, followed by a 2 digit hour
        
    Some examples:
        Show all data recorded during the year 2009:
            bmclient -m query -r2009
        Show all data recorded between April 2008 and June 2008, inclusive
            bmclient -m query -r200804-200806
        Show all data recorded between 4AM and 5AM on 1st January 2002
            bmclient -m query -r2002010104
                OR
            bmclient -m query -r2002010104-2002010105

    The 'grouping' argument specifies if/how the results of the query should be grouped when they are displayed:
        t - do not group results, display overall total only (default)
        h - group results by hour
        d - group results by day
        m - group results by month
        y - group results by year

    The 'units' argument is explained above, in the 'dump' section.
