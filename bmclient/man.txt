.SH NAME
bmclient - Provides command-line access to the BitMeterOS database
.SH SYNOPSIS
bmclient -h|-v|-m<mode> <mode specific options>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides command-line access to the BitMeterOS database which contains network usage statistics.
.SS Dump all data
Dump all data using '-md' or '-m dump':
.br
    bmclient -m dump [-u <units>] [-f <format>]

Values allowed for 'units' are:
    b - all values displayed in bytes (default)
    a - values displayed with abbreviated units
    f - values displayed with full units

Values allowed for 'format' are:
    c - CSV format, suitable for import into a spreadsheet
    f - fixed width format, easier to read

.SS View a summary
Display a database summary using '-ms' or '-m summary':
    bmclient -m summary  [-a <host/adapter>]

The '-a' option is used to specify that only data for a particular host, or host/adapter combination, should be displayed. To specify that only data from one particular host should be displayed, use the -a option with the name (or alias) of the host as its argument. To specify that only data from one adapter on one host should be displayed, the argument should contain both the host and adapter names separated by a colon. Use the identifier 'local' to refer to the local host. For example:
    Display a summary of all data for the host 192.168.1.2
        bmclient -m summary -a 192.168.1.2
    Display a summary of all data for the adapter eth1 on host 192.168.1.2
        bmclient -m summary -a 192.168.1.2:eth1
    Display a summary of all data for the local host
        bmclient -m summary -a local
    Display a summary of all data for the adapter eth1 on the local host
        bmclient -m summary -a local:eth1

.SS Monitor current usage
Monitor current usage using '-mm' or '-m monitor'. This produces a continuously updating display of the current network usage:
    bmclient -m monitor [-t <display type>] [-d <direction>] [-w <max bar width>] [-x <max bar value>] [-a <host/adapter>]

Values allowed for 'display type' are:
    n - numeric, both upload and download values are displayed numerically (default)
    b - bar graph, either upload or download values are displayed as bars of varying width (see subsequent arguments)

The 'direction' argument is ignored unless a display type of 'b' (bar graph) is selected. Permitted values are:
    d - download, the length of the bars vary according to the current download speed (default)
    u - upload, the length of the bars vary according to the current upload speed

The 'max bar width' argument is ignored unless a display type of 'b' (bar graph) is selected.
    A numeric value must be supplied with this option, to indicate the width (in characters) of the longest bar that will be displayed (default is 69 to allow each line, including the numeric output, to fit on an 80 character display)

The 'max bar value' argument is ignored unless a display type of 'b' (bar graph) is selected.
    A numeric value must be supplied with this option, to indicate the maximum upload/download value (in bytes) that can be displayed before the bar reaches the maximum width specified by the 'max bar width' argument (default value is 100000)

The 'host/adapter' argument is explained above, in the 'summary' section.

.SS Query the database
Query the database using '-mq' or '-m query':
    bmclient -m query -r <range> [-g <grouping>] [-u <units>] [-a <host/adapter>]

The 'range' argument specifies the date/time range for which you want to see information. The range can consist of either 1 or 2 date components, if 2 date components are present then they must be separated by a hyphen. Each date component can be in 1 of 4 different formats, shown below:
    yyyy        - a 4 digit year
    yyyymm      - a year followed by a 2 digit month
    yyyymmdd    - a year and month followed by a 2 digit day
    yyyymmddhh  - a year, month and day, followed by a 2 digit hour

Some examples:
    Show all data recorded during the year 2009:
        bmclient -m query -r2009
    Show all data recorded between April 2008 and June 2008, inclusive
        bmclient -m query -r200804-200806
    Show all data recorded between 4AM and 5AM on 1st January 2002
        bmclient -m query -r2002010104
            OR
        bmclient -m query -r2002010104-2002010105

The 'grouping' argument specifies if/how the results of the query should be grouped when they are displayed:
    t - do not group results, display overall total only (default)
    h - group results by hour
    d - group results by day
    m - group results by month
    y - group results by year

The 'units' argument is explained above, in the 'dump' section.

The 'host/adapter' argument is explained above, in the 'summary' section.
